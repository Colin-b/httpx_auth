# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.0] - 2024-02-19
### Added
- Publicly expose `httpx_auth.SupportMultiAuth`, allowing multiple authentication support for every `httpx` authentication class that exists.
- Publicly expose `httpx_auth.TokenMemoryCache`, allowing to create custom Oauth2 token cache based on this default implementation.
- You can now provide your own HTML success (`success_html`) and failure (`failure_html`) display via the new `OAuth2.display` shared setting. Refer to documentation for more details.
- Support for refresh tokens in the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow.
- Support for refresh tokens in the Authorization code (with and without PKCE) flow.
- Thanks to the new `redirect_uri_domain` parameter on Authorization code (with and without PKCE) and Implicit flows, you can now provide the [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) to use in the `redirect_uri` when `localhost` (the default) is not allowed.

### Changed
- Except for `httpx_auth.testing`, only direct access via `httpx_auth.` was considered publicly exposed. This is now explicit, as inner packages are now using private prefix (`_`).
  If you were relying on some classes or functions that are now internal, feel free to open an issue.
- Browser display settings have been moved to a shared setting, see documentation for more information on `httpx_auth.OAuth2.display`.
  The failure page will be displayed for 10 seconds by default instead of 5 seconds previously.
  As a result the following classes no longer expose `success_display_time` and `failure_display_time` parameters.
  - `httpx_auth.OAuth2AuthorizationCode`.
  - `httpx_auth.OktaAuthorizationCode`.
  - `httpx_auth.WakaTimeAuthorizationCode`.
  - `httpx_auth.OAuth2AuthorizationCodePKCE`.
  - `httpx_auth.OktaAuthorizationCodePKCE`.
  - `httpx_auth.OAuth2Implicit`.
  - `httpx_auth.AzureActiveDirectoryImplicit`.
  - `httpx_auth.AzureActiveDirectoryImplicitIdToken`.
  - `httpx_auth.OktaImplicit`.
  - `httpx_auth.OktaImplicitIdToken`.
- The authentication success and failure displayed in the browser were revamped to be more user-friendly. `httpx_auth.testing` was modified to accommodate this change:
  - `tab.assert_success` `expected_message` parameter was removed.
  - `tab.assert_failure` `expected_message` parameter should not be prefixed with `Unable to properly perform authentication: ` anymore and `\n` in the message should be replaced with `<br>`.
- `httpx_auth.JsonTokenFileCache` does not expose `tokens_path` or `last_save_time` attributes anymore and is also allowing `pathlib.Path` instances as cache location.
- `httpx_auth.TokenMemoryCache` does not expose `forbid_concurrent_cache_access` or `forbid_concurrent_missing_token_function_call` attributes anymore.
- `httpx_auth.JsonTokenFileCache` and `httpx_auth.TokenMemoryCache` `get_token` method now handles a new optional parameter named `on_expired_token`.

### Fixed
- `httpx_auth.OktaClientCredentials` `scope` parameter is now mandatory and does not default to `openid` anymore.
- `httpx_auth.OktaClientCredentials` will now display a more user-friendly error message in case Okta instance is not provided.
- Tokens cache `DEBUG` logs will not display tokens anymore.

## [0.20.0] - 2024-02-12
### Fixed
- Remove deprecation warnings due to usage of `utcnow` and `utcfromtimestamp`. Thanks to [`Raphael Krupinski`](https://github.com/rafalkrupinski).
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth.default_include_headers` value kept growing in size every time a new `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` instance was created with `security_token` parameter provided. Thanks to [`Miikka Koskinen`](https://github.com/miikka).
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` is now based almost entirely on AWS documentation, diverging from the original implementation based on `requests-aws4auth` and solving implementation issues in the process.
  - As the AWS documentation might be wrong or not exhaustive enough, feel free to open issues, should you encounter edge cases.

### Changed
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth.default_include_headers` is not available anymore, use `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` `include_headers` parameter instead to include additional headers if the default does not fit your need (refer to documentation for an exhaustive list).
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` `include_headers` values will not be stripped anymore, meaning that you can now include headers prefixed and/or suffixed with blank spaces.
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` does not includes `date` header by default anymore. You will have to provide it via `include_headers` yourself if you need to.
  - Note that it should not be required as `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` is sending `x-amz-date` by default and AWS documentation states that the request date can be specified by using either the HTTP `Date` or the `x-amz-date` header. If both headers are present, `x-amz-date` takes precedence.
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` `include_headers` does not needs to include `host`, `content-type` or `x-amz-*` anymore as those headers will always be included. It is now expected to be provided as a list of additional headers.
- `httpx_auth.AWS4Auth` will not modify the headers values spaces when computing the canonical headers, only trim leading and trailing whitespaces as per AWS documentation.

- Requires [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org)==0.14.*

### Added
- Still under development, subject to breaking changes without notice: `AWS4Auth` authentication class for AWS. Ported from [`requests-aws4auth`](https://github.com/sam-washington/requests-aws4auth) by [`Michael E. Martinka`](https://github.com/martinka).
Note that a few changes were made:
  - Deprecated `amz_date` attribute has been removed.
  - It is not possible to provide an `AWSSigningKey` instance, use explicit parameters instead.
  - It is not possible to provide a `date`. It will default to now.

  - `include_hdrs` parameter was renamed into `include_headers`
  - `host` is not considered as a specific Amazon service anymore (no test specific code).
  - Each request now has its own signing key and `x-amz-date`. Meaning you can use the same auth instance for more than one request.
  - `session_token` was renamed into `security_token` for consistency with the underlying name at Amazon.
